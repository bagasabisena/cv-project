I recommend to install Anaconda Python distribution first, this simplify the installation of required package and also compilation of C package such as openCV and PIL (Python Imaging Library)

Download and install from this [link](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/). Choose Python 2.7 version

Once Anaconda python is installed, export the environment.yml

``conda env create -f environment.yml``

Then activate the environment

Mac or Linux:
``source activate cv-project``

Windows:
``activate cv-project``

Run the main.py

``python main.py``
